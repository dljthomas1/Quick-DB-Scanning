This Python script provides a quick and easy way to peform DB scanning on geographic coordinates. DB scan differs from K Means clustering in that clusters are not equally size, must reach a minimum critical mass of points to be considered a cluster, and only includes points which are x distance the cluster.

For example, in the accompanying example jupyter notebook, we identify clusters of innovative firms in London that have at elast 8 firms, and where no firm is more than 600m from another firm in the cluster.
