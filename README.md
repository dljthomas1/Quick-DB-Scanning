This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of my DB Scan script. The script be used to identify 
clusters defined by the user. Ie, a point is only included in a cluster if the cluster itself 
reaches a critical mass of points, and the user can set a maximum distance at which point a point
can no longer be considered a part of the same cluster.
